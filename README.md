# NetflixGPT

ü§ñAn AI-powered movie search app built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux for state management. It integrates the Gemini API to suggest movies based on user preferences. I built it from scratch, manually configuring bundlers, and incorporated features like routing, Firebase authentication, multi-language support, YouTube trailer embedding, and responsive design. This project delivers a unique, AI-driven search experience, enhancing the way users find content.üöÄ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è - The API used in this application (The Movie Database) is currently not available in India, which makes the app non-functional. To run this app on your machine, make sure to enable the public DNS settings in your browser.

# This app is built from scratch by configuring bundlers manually, instead of using the default setup like create-react-app.

## Key Features:

## Routing Configuration: Managed and set up routing to navigate between different pages.
## Authentication: Implemented user authentication using Firebase.
## Conditional Loading: Pages are only accessible after successful authentication.
## Reusable Components: Converted most functions into custom hooks for reusability and modularity.
## State Management: Created a Redux store to serve as a centralized state management system for the app.
## API Integration: Fetched movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
## YouTube Embedding: Mapped movie trailers fetched from TMDB to YouTube videos for a better user experience.
## Multi-language Support: Implemented multi-language features to support content in different languages.

## AI Integration: Integrated GPT to suggest favorite theme-based movies based on user preferences.

## Responsive Design: Ensured the site is responsive across devices.
